        <section class="post-excerpt">
            A client emailed to say they had forgotten a password for their Microsoft Excel .xls document and asked if it was possible to recover it. After searching on Google it was clear that there was plenty of shi...bloatware, which may have worked if you were willing to go through a few of them and pay a few dollars. It wasn't that important of a document according to the client but nevertheless a challenge is a challenge.

The document was encrypted when using 'save as', according to various sources online the encryption algorithm is 40bit RC4. As it is encrypted nothing could be gleaned by opening the document with a hex editor.

As always when Google turns up nothing useful I turn to Twitter. A few people recommended <a href="http://www.elcomsoft.co.uk/">Elcomsoft</a> which do Windows software to both recover and obtain the password of a Microsoft Excel document. This looked like a good bet and they offer free trials! The recover software which seems to do a brute force attack looked like it could have worked (especially now I know how weak the password was) but I was running the software on a Virtual Machine. The recovery tool unfortunately didn't reveal the password, the paid for version may have, I don't know.

            The new OWASP Top 10 2013 was released not so long ago, while reading over it I noticed this:

"Attackers can trick victims into performing any state changing operation the victim is authorized to perform, e.g., updating account details, making purchases, logout and <strong>even login</strong>." - <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A8-Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)" target="_blank">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A8-Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)</a>

This must be a mistake I thought, why would you ever want to CSRF a user to log them into their own account? If you already had their login credentials this must be utterly pointless.

Today I came across an academic paper which gives three examples of why Login CSRF can be an issue and how wrong I was.

<strong>Google</strong>

"Search History. Many search engines, including Yahoo! and Google, allow their users to opt-in to saving their search history and provide an interface for a user to review his or her personal search history. Search queries contain sensitive details about the user’s interests and activities [41, 4] and could be used by an attacker to embarrass the user, to steal the user’s identity, or to spy on the user. An attacker can spy on a user’s search history by logging the user into the search engine as the attacker; see Figure 1. The user’s search queries are then stored in the attacker’s search history, and the attacker can retrieve the queries by logging into his or her own account."

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            HTTP Form password brute forcing is not rocket science, you try multiple username/password combinations until you get a correct answer (or non-negative answer).

Password brute forcing, especially over a network, takes time and while your software is attempting to find a correct username/password combination it is taking up your and the remote system's resources. While the brute force is being carried out you might not want to run an automated scan, for example, as the remote server may not be able to cope with the amount of connections or the rapid succession of connections. At the same time, your network bandwidth and system memory are also limited. It makes sense that when you conduct a weak password brute force it is done as fast as possible so that your time and resources are restored for other tasks.

And of course not forgetting that you're always going to be limited by time on a pentest/web app assessment as the client's budget is never unlimited.

So what is the fastest way to brute force a HTTP form today? I use Burp Suite for my Web Application Security Assessments and I would normally use Burp's Intruder, but is this the fastest tool to do it with?

Of course, there are other limiting factors when brute forcing remotely such as your Internet/Network speed, CPU speed, RAM and the remote system's response times, as well as other factors. For this experiment we'll only be focusing on the software used to carry out the password brute force attack. This is far from being a perfect in-depth study but it should hopefully give an idea which tool out of my small collection (Burp Intruder Spider Vs Hydra http-post-form) is fastest.

<strong>The Setup</strong>

On both tools I set one user to brute force, admin, and used the <a href="http://ethicalhack3r.co.uk/files/fuzzing/rockyou-75.txt" target="_blank">rockyou-75.txt</a> wordlist (19963 lines), which has one addition which is the correct password which was added to the last line of the file. Both the same username and password list was used for Burp's Intruder (Sniper) and Hydra. Each tool was run one after the other, not at the same time.

Burp Suite Professional Intruder (Sniper) Version: 1.5.11
Hydra (http-post-form) Version: 7.4.2

A "Local" test was carried out on a localhost Apache 2 web server as well as a "Remote" test against the www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk Nginx web server.

The <a href="http://pastebin.com/xV80ZHBj" target="_blank">Test Form</a> that I created to test against (both locally and remotely) does not make a database call which is what would normally be expected on a real HTTP login form. I'd expect my test login form to reply quicker than if it had to make a database call. The 'Local' and 'Remote' columns represent the time it took the tool to find the correct password which was at the end of the wordlist.

            <strong>EDIT 19.04.2013 10:17 ---</strong>
<strong>WARNING!</strong> This did break the Tor Browser Bundle on my machine. The error was "Couldn't set maximum number of file descriptors: Invalid argument"
<strong>---</strong>

For as long as I can remember, when <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2008/02/13/how-to-use-ssh-as-a-proxy-server/" target="_blank">using SSH as a forward proxy</a> to proxy Burp Suite through an upstream server I have gotten a "accept : too many open files" error in my Mac OS X Terminal after a couple of hours of using Burp's Proxy and/or Scanner.

When searching Google the first solution I came across was to set the 'ulimit' to something higher, as far as I can tell 'ulimit' sets user system limits such as how many open files a user is allowed to have open at once.

On OS X when attempting to set this limit to 'unlimited' I always got an error, "Neither the hard nor soft limit for "maxfiles" can be unlimited. Please use a numeric parameter for both.", or when setting the ulimit to something higher than the default (256) the error (accept : too many open files) would still not go away or at least not for long. The only thing I found that would get rid of the error was to kill my ssh session and spawn a new one.

After further reading, some forums and blogs suggested updating openssh, I did this and the issue persisted. I thought the issue may have been openssl, so I updated that, the issue persisted.

I also <a href="https://twitter.com/ethicalhack3r/status/313982186695036928" target="_blank">tweeted</a> about the issue where the suggestion of adjusting the ulimit resurfaced, but I just couldn't get ulimit to fix the issue.

            This week we have another two videos lined up for you. The first, by <a href="https://twitter.com/haroonmeer" target="_blank">Haroon Meer</a>, I was luckily enough to see in person at Brucon 2011. It is one of the best talks I have ever had the privilege to see, by anyone. If you're ever going to watch one of these 'Weekly Viewing' videos of mine make it be this one.

The second video is by Matz, the creator of Ruby, where he talks about Ruby's development and the new features of Ruby 2.0. In his talk Matz says that Ruby 1.8 will die soon. So update already! ;)

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            On the 14th of January the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) sent Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Limited a <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/enforcement/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Notices/sony_monetary_penalty_notice.ashx" target="_blank">monetary penalty notice</a> of £250,000 following 'a serious breach of the Data Protection Act'.

To be able to quantify how much the ICO was fining Sony for individual user's data the exact number of UK PSN users would need to be known. A couple of sources put this number at 3 million but I'm not sure where the original 3 million figure came from nor how accurate it really is [0][1].

If we were to take this 3 million figure at face value, the ICO fined Sony (£250,000 / 3,000,000) £0.000083 per user's data. According to the ICO, £250,000 is 'reasonable and proportionate' in this case. To get a more accurate figure I sent the ICO a FOI request to ask for the redacted figure in the monetary penalty notice document which simply states "The Network Platform was used by an estimated REDACTED million customers in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand with REDACTED million of those customers based in the UK.".

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            WordPress 3.5 was recently released which now comes with the WordPress API "always enabled". Personally I think this adds unnecessary risk by increasing the attack surface. How many WordPress user's actually use the API? I would put my money on it being a very small fraction, either way I'm sure the WordPress Core Development team had good reason to enable the API by default. After spending 5 minutes looking for where to turn the API off in WordPress 3.5 I gave up. Huh, I'll have another look sometime soon.

I've had a play with the API in the past, however, I've always found it hard to get going as the information on how to interact with the API is a bit sparse. Having played with it for an hour or so this evening I thought I'd share some of the information on how to get started (as well as a self reminder ;).

The latest API calls can be found on WordPress's Codex <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_WordPress_API" target="_blank">here</a>. It doesn't list all available calls, to find these let's extract them from the 'wp-includes/class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php' file.

            There have been many cases recently where people in the UK have been arrested under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/27/contents">Malicious Communications Act 1988</a> as well as others such as the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/contents">Communications Act of 2003</a> and the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/contents">Terrorism Act 2006</a> for what they have said on social media web sites such as Twitter or Facebook. Paul Chambers <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/2010/01/18/ill-advised-twitter-post-sparks-uk-terror-arrest/">seems to have been the first</a> in the UK to be arrested for what he said on Twitter in 2010. He later appealed and recently had his conviction <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2179782/Twitter-joke-trial-Paul-Chambers-wins-appeal-conviction-airport-bomb-Tweet.html">quashed</a>.
