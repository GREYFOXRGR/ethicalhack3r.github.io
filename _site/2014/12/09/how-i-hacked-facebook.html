        <h1 class="post-title">How I hacked Facebook</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Ok, ok. I didn&#39;t quite &quot;hack Facebook&quot;. What I did was execute OS level commands on one of Facebook&#39;s acquisition&#39;s servers.</p>

<p>This is how I did it.</p>

<p>One day last September I was in bed with terrible flu. While I was bedridden I got bored and started to poke around Facebook&#39;s Bug Bounty program. I have participated in Bug Bounties before but never Facebook&#39;s.</p>

<p>This is by no means a complicated hack by the way, but it worked.</p>

<p>I started by port scanning Facebook&#39;s in scope domains with Nmap. Probed a few listening services on IPs that looked interesting.</p>

<p>I also started to look at Facebook&#39;s acquisitions. Doing the same, port scanning common ports, probing services that looked interesting.</p>

<p>On one of Facebook&#39;s acquisition&#39;s IPs they had Jenkins running on a common port. I opened it up in my browser but unfortunately it prompted me with a Basic Authentication login box. I assume this is where most other bounty hunters and Facebook&#39;s own security team stopped testing.</p>

<p>I decided to do a full port scan with nmap. The results showed another Jenkins service running on a less common port. Accessing it over this less common port it did not prompt me for authentication. Bingo!</p>

<p>For those of you that do not know, Jenkins is a &#39;continuous integration server&#39;. Once authenticated it allows you to run &#39;Groovy script&#39; through the &#39;Jenkins Script Console&#39;. </p>

<p>By using Groovy script and the Jenkins Script Console I was able to execute commands on the server under the &#39;jenkins&#39; user.</p>

<p>Example Groovy script to run the <code>whoami</code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">def command = &quot;&quot;&quot;whoami&quot;&quot;&quot;
def proc = command.execute()
proc.waitFor()

println &quot;stdout: ${proc.in.text}&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>I reported this issue to Facebook and they patched it very fast. I was awarded $7,500 through their bug bounty program. The payment took a few months to come through and lots of emails back and forth. But it came through in the end.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the takeaway? Don&#39;t forget the basics. I was able to find a pretty risky bug in one of Facebook&#39;s acquisitions from within my bed by just using Nmap.</p>

<p>I would like to say thank you to Facebook for the payment and I hope I can report more bugs to them in the future.</p>
