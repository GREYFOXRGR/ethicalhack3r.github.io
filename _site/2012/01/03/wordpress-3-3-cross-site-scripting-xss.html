        <h1 class="post-title">WordPress 3.3 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Yesterday two Indian security researchers, Aditya Modha & Samir Shah, released an <a href="http://oldmanlab.blogspot.com/2012/01/wordpress-33-xss-vulnerability.html" target="_blank">advisory</a> outlining a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the latest version (at the time of writing) of WordPress 3.3. Many people started re-tweeting the news (including myself) and <a href="http://thehackernews.com/2012/01/zero-day-reflected-cross-site-scripting.html" target="_blank">blogging</a> about it. The problem came when I tried to reproduce the vulnerability, I couldn't.</p>

<p>I started to think that the vulnerability was a miss-understanding or publicity stunt and was getting annoyed at the many people who were spreading miss-information. I contacted the researchers over <a href="http://www.twitter.com/oldmanlab" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and told them that I was unable to reproduce the vulnerability in any browser or on any WordPress installation including vanilla installs.</p>

<p>The researchers got back in touch with a link to a WordPress installation on which the vulnerability worked. The URL they gave me was an IP address. Within their environment the XSS worked.</p>

<p>At this point I think even the researchers were puzzled. They sent me this code that they believed was the function causing the XSS within wp-includes/functions.php <a href="http://pastebin.com/iBnpN8Zm" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/iBnpN8Zm</a>.</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-16709"></a></p>

<p>[php]<br />
function wp_guess_url() {<br />
    if ( defined('WP_SITEURL') && '' != WP_SITEURL ) {<br />
        $url = WP_SITEURL;<br />
    } else {<br />
        $schema = is_ssl() ? 'https://' : 'http://';<br />
        $url = preg_replace('|/wp-admin/.*|i', '', $schema . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);<br />
    }<br />
    return rtrim($url, '/');<br />
}<br />
[/php]</p>

<p>The XSS occurs because $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] (the URI which was given in order to access the page) was used within output before first being sanitized. Or better yet, it shouldn't have been used at all.</p>

<p>The reason I couldn't reproduce it or why the researchers couldn't reproduce outside of their environment? The reason is the 'else' never gets triggered when WordPress was installed via a domain.</p>

<p>If you installed WordPress by accessing http://192.168.100.110/, for example, you are vulnerable. If however, like most people, but not all, installed WordPress via the domain name, http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk you are not vulnerable.</p>

<p>Quick and easy fix until WordPress release a patch? Put $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] through esc_html() first, esc_html($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']).</p>

<p>Example (tested):</p>

<p>wp-includes/functions.php:3756<br />
[php]<br />
$url = preg_replace('|/wp-admin/.*|i', '', $schema . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . esc_html($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']));<br />
[/php]</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE --</strong></p>

<p>WordPress 3.3.1 has been released that seems to fix the issue.</p>
