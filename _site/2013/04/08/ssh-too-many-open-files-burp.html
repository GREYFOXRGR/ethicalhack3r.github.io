        <h1 class="post-title">SSH "accept : too many open files" on OS X when using Burp</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p><strong>EDIT 19.04.2013 10:17 ---</strong><br />
<strong>WARNING!</strong> This did break the Tor Browser Bundle on my machine. The error was "Couldn't set maximum number of file descriptors: Invalid argument"<br />
<strong>---</strong></p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, when <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2008/02/13/how-to-use-ssh-as-a-proxy-server/" target="_blank">using SSH as a forward proxy</a> to proxy Burp Suite through an upstream server I have gotten a "accept : too many open files" error in my Mac OS X Terminal after a couple of hours of using Burp's Proxy and/or Scanner.</p>

<p>When searching Google the first solution I came across was to set the 'ulimit' to something higher, as far as I can tell 'ulimit' sets user system limits such as how many open files a user is allowed to have open at once.</p>

<p>On OS X when attempting to set this limit to 'unlimited' I always got an error, "Neither the hard nor soft limit for "maxfiles" can be unlimited. Please use a numeric parameter for both.", or when setting the ulimit to something higher than the default (256) the error (accept : too many open files) would still not go away or at least not for long. The only thing I found that would get rid of the error was to kill my ssh session and spawn a new one.</p>

<p>After further reading, some forums and blogs suggested updating openssh, I did this and the issue persisted. I thought the issue may have been openssl, so I updated that, the issue persisted.</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://twitter.com/ethicalhack3r/status/313982186695036928" target="_blank">tweeted</a> about the issue where the suggestion of adjusting the ulimit resurfaced, but I just couldn't get ulimit to fix the issue.</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-17001"></a></p>

<p>Finally, I came across <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/302754/increase-the-maximum-number-of-open-file-descriptors-in-snow-leopard" target="_blank">this</a> post on superuser.com where the errant.info user suggests to issue the following commands:</p>

<p>[code language="bash"]<br />
echo 'kern.maxfiles=20480' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf<br />
echo -e 'limit maxfiles 8192 20480\nlimit maxproc 1000 2000' | sudo tee -a /etc/launchd.conf<br />
echo 'ulimit -n 4096' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile<br />
[/code]</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the above seems to set a kernal limit, system limit and also the user's ulimit. After a system restart, the error has now gone!</p>

<p>The user also adds some additional notes:</p>

<p>[code]<br />
You will need to restart for these changes to take effect.<br />
AFAIK you can no longer set limits to 'unlimited' under OS X<br />
launchctl maxfiles are bounded by sysctl maxfiles, and therefore cannot exceed them<br />
sysctl seems to inherit kern.maxfilesperproc from launchctl maxfiles<br />
ulimit seems to inherit it's 'open files' value from launchctl by default<br />
you can set a custom ulimit within /etc/profile, or ~/.profile ; while this isn't required I've provided an example<br />
Be cautious when setting any of these values to a very high number when compared with their default - the features exist stability/security. I've taken these example numbers that I believe to be reasonable, written on other websites.<br />
[/code]</p>

<p>I'm sure I am not the only one who has come across this before, so hopefully it is useful to other Burp Suite user's who use SSH as a forwarding proxy on Mac OS X. It worked for me so should hopefully work for you too.</p>
