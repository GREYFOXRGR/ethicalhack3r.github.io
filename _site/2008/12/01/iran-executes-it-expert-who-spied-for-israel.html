        <h1 class="post-title">Iran executes IT expert who spied for Israel</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <blockquote>A COMPUTER expert has been executed in Iran after he confessed to working for Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. This provides a rare insight into the intense espionage activity inside the Islamic republic.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong><br />
He was obviously playing a dangerous game and paid for it with his life.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Ali Ashtari, 43, a computer and hi-tech equipment buyer for Iran’s defence industry and nuclear programme, was hanged after admitting he worked for Israel. It is the first known conviction of an alleged Israeli agent in Iran for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>Ashtari was trusted by senior officials to travel overseas to buy the advanced computers and other electronic equipment needed for the regime’s nuclear programme, which is reported to have already produced enough enriched uranium to make an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Behind their backs he allowed the software he bought to be subtly doctored by Israeli computer engineers before it was imported to Iran. Ashtari confessed: “Mossad’s goal was to sell specialised computer equipment through me to Iranian intelligence organisations.”</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />
</strong><br />
You would have thought that Iran would have been more careful as to who they employ and how trustworthy they are. Who knows how many backdoors are still open within Iran's nuclear facility?!</p>
