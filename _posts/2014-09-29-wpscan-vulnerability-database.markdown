I am pleased to announce that I launched the <a href="https://wpvulndb.com/">WPScan Vulnerability Database</a>, a WordPress Vulnerability Database, last week during the BruCON security conference in Ghent, Belgium. The WPScan Vulnerability Database's development was funded by BruCON's 5by5 project, talked about in a <a href="http://blog.dewhurstsecurity.com/2014/02/11/brucon-5by5-wpscan-online-vulnerability-database.html">previous post</a>.

The new vulnerability database will make WPScan's database files more accessible to the public by presenting them in a more consumable manner within a web interface. This will also make the management of the vulnerabilities we have sourced over the years much easier. Within the new website there is the functionality to submit new vulnerabilities directly to us which are then moderated before being put live on the website. All issues entered into the WPScan Vulnerability Database is done manually.

As within the WPScan software, the new website will be tracking WordPress Core, Plugin and Theme vulnerabilities.

The new website brings with it an <a href="https://wpvulndb.com/api">API</a> so that other developers and our users can make use of our data for free so long as that usage is non-commercial and we are credited accordingly. Any potential commercial usage of our data will require a software license. If you are interested in a commercial license <a href="https://wpvulndb.com/contact">get in touch</a>.

The WPScan Vulnerability Database was officially launched on Friday September 26th 2014 just before my talk about the project at <a href="http://brucon.org/">BruCON</a>. Over the weekend we have had over 4,000 visits to the website. Some developers are already making use of the vulnerability RSS feeds by automatically tweeting our new vulnerability entries.

Since the launch there have already been some improvements to the website as we get feedback from our users, one improvement was adding CWE classifications to our vulnerabilities. There are also lots of other improvements in the pipeline which we hope to make available as soon as possible.

At the same time as the WPScan Vulnerability Database launch a new version of <a href="http://wpscan.org/">WPScan</a> was launched, version 2.5, which incorporates many bug fixes and enhancements. It should hopefully be hitting Kali Linuxâ€™s and other pentest distribution update repositories soon.

I'd like to thank BruCON for giving me the opportunity to develop the WPScan Vulnerability Database, my 5by5 mentor and the <a href="https://wpvulndb.com/about">WPScan Team</a>.
